## 1️⃣ DAX Practice & Measure Development

**File:** `DAX_practice.pbix`

### Objective
Build strong foundations in **DAX**, the analytical language behind Power BI.

### Work Performed
- Created calculated columns and measures
- Implemented:
  - Aggregations (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)
  - Time intelligence functions
  - Conditional logic
- Optimized calculations for performance

### Concepts Demonstrated
- Row context vs filter context
- Measure vs calculated column
- DAX evaluation logic


“Explain row context and filter context in DAX.”
